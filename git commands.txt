Steps to check in code in git:

1. Create new folder next to folder/file you want to check-in.
2. In CMD, go to newly created folder and run command git init.
3. Copy the file/folder you want to check-in to newly created folder.
4. Run command git add .
5. Run command git commit . -m "your comments"
6. Above command may give error if runs first time that "fatal: unable to auto-detect email address". 
In that case run following command git config --global user.email "you@example.com". Email address is which
you used in your github.
7. Run command git remote add origin https://github.com/kunal17101992/Code-Deployment.git 
If above command gives fatal error then replace 'origin' with 'github' and try.
This link should be with you at the time of repository creation.
8. Run command git pull --rebase origin master if you have other commited folders/file in repository.
if do not have any existing file/folder in repository then you may skip this command.
8. Run command git push -u origin master
